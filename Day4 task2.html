   <p><h3> <b>Ingredients: </b></h3></p>
   <ul>
    <li> 2 Tea spoon active dry yeast</li>
    <li>One cup warm water</li>
    <li>3 Cups flour</li>
    <li> 1 Table spoon white sugar</li>
    <li>Salt </li>
    <li>1 Egg</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Black pepper,onion powder</li>
    <li>1 Cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
   </ul>
   <p> <h3> Directions</h3></p>
   <i> Step:1</i>
   <p>Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a small bowl. The water should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.</p>
   <i> Step:2</i>
   <p> Sift flour, sugar, 1 tablespoon oregano, and 1 teaspoon salt into a large bowl. Mix egg and oil into dry ingredients; stir in yeast mixture. When dough has pulled together, turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</p>
   <i> Step:3</i>
   <p>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (235 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.</p>
   <i>Step:4</i>
   <p>Cook and stir diced tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, 1 tablespoon oregano, garlic, onion powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook until sauce has thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
   <i>Step:5</i>
   <p>Punch down dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Use a knife to divide dough into two equal pieces--do not tear. Shape dough into rounds and let rest for 10 minutes. Form dough into rectangles, and place onto prepared baking sheet. Spoon tomato sauce over dough. Sprinkle with 1 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese; top with bell pepper, onion, and mushroom. Sprinkle 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese over top.

   </p>
   <i>step:6</i>
   <p>Bake in preheated oven until crust is browned and crisp and cheese has melted, 20 to 25 minutes.
